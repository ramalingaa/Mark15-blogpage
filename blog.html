    <h1>Why do Humans record History?</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Humans were there on earth for more than million years but not in the form of Sapiens. In the beginning we were not given any importance nor any special abilities among the other creatures.Roughly before 10000 years there were different species of humans existed all over the world. Indian mythology Ramayan is good example of coexistence of different human species at the same time. Our anscestors timeline dates back to more 30,000 years according to recent fiinding in Siberia. Interesting thing is we only remember few events of that history when humans started recording it. Before that we need to understand how humans, a small creatures like chimanzees were able to take down on other animals like giant mammoth. The only reason is they constantly communicated the things they know to upcoming generations so that they can build on that. We can observe this behavior in wild monkeys in Africa. Lions pose a great threat to monkeys and to avoid this, monkeys often kidnap lion cubs and kill them eventually. This behaviour is observed for more than one hundred years as per scientific community. You can live today with the knowledge you have but to to be able to withstand the hardships that nature pose your must be prepared. There is only one way to be prepared i.e, understading the previous experiences and acting on top of that. This method helped humans evolve so drastically that even creatures on top of food chains couldm't act. While human species are roaming around the world few settled in remote areas. Dwarf humans near arcitic is good example of this. They are little creatures compared to other human species but they posses the same abilities as normal human. And the other kind homo erectus are the strongest among the Human species like Hanuman who lived in Europe and are far advanced than Sapiens.They are far more advance than any other human species. And similar speciees lived in other part of the world like Indonasia, Japan, China, Tibetan land.One reaserch suggests there were at least dozen kind of human species lived on earth before Homo sapiens taken over the world. But interesting part is Sapiens are neither strong nor wise when compared to Homo erectus. This data is only a drop in unexplored sea of past. If we could have access to their life style who knows we could've find a cure many disecases with the help of gene data. Finally it is always interesting to know how our anscestors fought with handmade stone knives to bring downn gigantic animals and rouse to top of food chain.</p>
